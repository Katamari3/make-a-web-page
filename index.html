    <div class="concepts">
      <div class="concept-title">How the web works:</div>
        <p class="concept-body">
          There is the <em class="italic-bold">user</em> who uses a browser to display the information on their computer screen.<br><br>
          There is the <em class="italic-bold">internet/web</em> which evnetually connects users to the desired content.<br><br>
          There are <em class="italic-bold">servers</em> which host the content.<br><br>
          And <em class="italic-bold">HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)</em>is the 'language' used for many of the content hosted on the servers.<br><br>
          And, by the way, <em class="italic-bold">HTTP</em> is how computers send requests for content to the server.

    <div class="concepts">
      <div class="concept-title">What is a HTML document:</div>
        <p class="concept-body">
          It can be text, images, videos, links, files, etc. Pretty much anything.<br><br>
          It gives instructions on <em class="italic-bold">WHAT people should see</em> and <em class="italic-bold">HOW people should see it.</em><br><br>
          These instructions are very precise because computers are <em class="italic-bold">STUPID</em> - they can and will only do what they are told to.<br><br>
          A tiny spelling mistake by the programmer will not be just a tiny spelling mistake but <em class="italic-bold">the reason why the whole program doesn't work!</em><br>
          An important thing to remember until we get used to it.<br><br>
          We tend to take for granted how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence">intelligent</a> human beings are.<br>

        Tags: usually have an opening tag and closing tag<br><br>
        Void tags:  don't require a closing tag because it has no content<br><br>
        <b>Bold</b><br><br>
        <em>Italics</em><br><br>
        Paragraphs<br><br>
        Breaks<br><br>
        Anchor tag: is for creating <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">a link</a> <br>
        Image tag: to show a <img class="cat"src="http://www.online-image-editor.com//styles/2014/images/example_image.png" alt="too bad you can't see the cute cat"><br><br>
        Attributes: href (web address), src (source=where to find the image), alt (alternate=text displayed when image doesn't load), etc<br><br>
        <em class="italic-bold">Inline vs Block</em> elements:  'break' is <u>inline</u> and 'paragraph' is <u>block</u>.  A block is like an invisible block.<br>

          Three languages used in most websites.  Each language has a different role.<br><br>
          HTML=structure<br>
          CSS=decor/style <br>
          Java=interaction<br>
        <br>
          There are <em class="italic-bold">structures</em> and there are <em class="italic-bold">styles</em><br><br>
          Then there are <em class="italic-bold">trees</em> and there are <em class="italic-bold">boxes</em>.

          (1) Google <u>developer tools</u> allow us to see the code behind the website.<br><br>
          (2) There are two sections:  one to see the <em class="italic-bold">structure</em>, and one to see the <em>style</em><br><br>
          (3) You can see in the code (HTML bit) the structure of the website as a <em class="italic-bold">'tree'</em> (as in a family tree rather than a real tree), branching all the way to the end until you see the actual text<br><br> 
          (4) Analysing from what you see:  <u><em class="italic-bold">webpages are made of boxes</em></u>- regardless of the shape of what you see.<br><br>
          (5) Deconstructing into boxes: helps you see the structure or groups of elements that form blocks of information<br>

    <h2>Lesson 3</h2>
      <div class="concepts">
        <div class="concept-title">Creating structure:</div>
          <p class="concept-body">
            Structure in HTML is important because it would affect the code efficiency when we start adding style (and eventually interactivity, I guess) with CSS.<br><br>
            Creating structure is about <em class="italic-bold">grouping and labelling similar elements</em> so they can be addressed as a 'group' rather than individually, one by one.  This helps to avoid repetition.<br><br>
            We do this by using, for example, 'div' which sort of means box/block, 'span' which can group inline elements, and 'class' which are labels.<br>
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="concepts">
        <div class="concept-title">Avoiding repetition:</div>
          <p class="concept-body">
            Repetition is boring.<br><br>
            Too much repetition raises the chances of <em class="italic-bold">making mistakes.</em><br><br>
            Repeating the same code means more code => more things the browser needs to process => takes longer to display => bad user experience => <em class="italic-bold">not what you want.</em>
